                            Opening Paragraph
    Our bodies are incredible, intricate instruments that are made entirely out of energy. The same energy that comprises the whole Universe, yep, we are star stuff! Our bodies generate an energy field that radiates out from us in all directions, about 12 feet or so. This energy field can become distorted or negative, destructive energies can get trapped within it. When this happens, we experience physical or emotional pain.  Finding and correcting these imbalances allows our bodies to heal themselves. That‚Äôs what I do here at Life‚Äôs Wifi,  I listen to your body and help it to get what it needs to heal itself and to let go of the emotional baggage that you may be lugging around.

                            Emotion Code
    The concept of a Trapped Emotion can be strange if you‚Äôve never heard of it before, especially if you‚Äôre not familiar with energy work, but just think of it as emotional baggage.  Most people have heard of emotional baggage and unknowingly carry quite a load from their traumatic life events.  Emotional baggage/Trapped Emotions are very real, and although invisible, can really affect your happiness, success and health.
The Heart-Wall is just as it sounds, a wall around your heart, one that keeps you from giving and receiving love.  It is comprised of Trapped Emotions, which were intended to protect your heart during trauma, but if not released can contribute to many issues, including heart problems.
Inherited Trapped Emotions are very interesting, because they are passed down to us from our ancestors at the time of conception, just like DNA. Maybe your families money troubles have been inherited down to each generation. Maybe the depression that seems to ‚Äúrun in the family‚Äù is really just an Inherited Trapped Emotion that each person is carrying around with them. When Inherited Trapped Emotions are released, it releases up the genealogy line, which could not only help you, but many of your ancestors as well!
It‚Äôs important to rid yourself of these negative energies before they cause bigger problems. Let‚Äôs get started today.
The Emotion Code addresses three main things:
‚Äì Trapped Emotions,
‚Äì Heart-Walls and
‚Äì Inherited Trapped Emotions.
The Emotion Code was discovered and written by Dr. Brad Nelson (He‚Äôs the guy I‚Äôm studying under.) üôÇ

                            Body Code
    The Body Code works in the same way as the Emotion Code and incorporates it as well, but on a much larger scale. A lot of it deals with the health of the energy body, such as: Trapped Emotions (emotional baggage), blocked Chakras or meridians, offensive energies and much more. There is a physical side as well where I look for things like infections, toxins, nutritional deficiencies and structural imbalances. Once we discover what is going on inside of you, your body will guide us on what to do next to correct the issues. Pretty cool huh?

                          Subconscious
    The Subconscious Mind is like a super computer, it records everything you have ever touched, tasted, smelled, heard, seen or felt. It knows all about everything you have ever experienced. It knows exactly what is going on inside your body and what it needs to correct the imbalances. But don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt tell me all your secrets. üòâ
In fact, it‚Äôs pretty vague on the details. Usually I only need to determine the age the event happened or perhaps where the energy is trapped in your body, sometimes we need to dig a little deeper and find out if it‚Äôs associated with family, work, school, friends, etc. So don‚Äôt worry about having to re-live hard times or feel embarrassed about something, ultimately it‚Äôs between you and your subconscious.

                          Muscle Testing
    ‚ÄúMuscle testing is a noninvasive tool we can use to identify imbalances in the body. The science behind it is similar to a lie detector test or a polygraph. In a polygraph, a person is hooked up to sensitive electrodes and asked certain questions. The person‚Äôs answers generate a certain electrical response in the body, which is read and graphed by the machine, showing if the answers are true or false. This is done on a very delicate, minute scale. The muscles of the body are also affected by this electrical state- so we can use them to show this same response, just on a more pronounced, larger scale. Any muscle will become weakened in a state of incongruence or falsehood, making resistance difficult. Conversely, muscles will remain strong and able to resist when in a state of congruency or truth. What‚Äôs nice is that muscle testing allows us to access important information about health, we just have to know what questions to ask, then apply the resistance to a muscle and get our answers!‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Brad Nelson

Muscle testing is the key to your subconscious mind. There are many different ways to muscle test, but one of the easiest is the Sway Method. Stand comfortably with your hands resting at your side, (make sure there is no music, TV or distractions), close your eyes, clear your mind and say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù. It can take up to 10 seconds, but your body should sway forward and then return to neutral. Now say ‚ÄúNO‚Äù, you should sway backwards and then return to neutral. It takes a little practice to learn your bodies signals, but give it time and you will be a pro!

Muscle testing is all about noticing the subtle changes in your muscle strength. With other testing methods, your muscles will weaken if the answer to your question is a no or false statement and they will stay strong if it‚Äôs a yes or a true statement.

You can ask your body things like:
‚ÄúIs this supplement good for me?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo I need to drink more water per day?‚Äù
If yes, ask how many ounces: ‚Äú64 oz? 96 oz? 128 oz?‚Äù
Keep asking until you get a YES (strong muscle response or sway forward).

Remember not to overpower yourself, try to match your pressure. If you do it too hard, you will just have sore fingers!  There are many different methods, such as Sway Method, Ring in Ring Method, Falling Log Method, etc. Find what works best for you and practice practice practice.

                                Proxy
    Another incredible thing about this energy work is the ability to help anyone in the world! It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are on one side of the world and I‚Äôm on the opposite, I can still connect to your subconscious mind (with your permission of course!) and work to correct imbalances. I like to call this connection Life‚Äôs Wifi, we each have our own unique energetic signal which allows us to find and connect to each other. When I am connected to you over Life‚Äôs Wifi (Proxy: over a long distance), my body sets aside it‚Äôs own needs and acts on your behalf. Any muscle testing or imbalance corrections I do on myself actually affect you. Distance is no barrier!

                          Trapped Emotions
    Trapped Emotions are made of actual energies created from intense emotional events, which get stuck in our physical bodies. Each emotion vibrates at a different frequency, for example, overwhelm is a different vibration than shock or sadness. These Trapped Emotions are negative, destructive vibrations that distort the normal energy field of the body; which creates pain, malfunction, disease, depression, anxiety, phobias and many other issues. Releasing these destructive blockages allows the body to heal itself and return to normal function.
Are you ready to release your emotional baggage?

                        Heart Wall
    ‚ÄúDuring times of emotional pain or distress, your heart can be really hurt or injured, this is where the words ‚Äúheartache‚Äù and ‚Äúheartbreak‚Äù come from. Sometimes we need to put up a form of protection, or a ‚Äúwall‚Äù around the heart ‚Äì but you can‚Äôt build a wall of nothing, right? What ends up being used as ‚Äúbuilding materials‚Äù are the most common excess energies in the body, Trapped Emotions. The problem is that the Heart-Wall doesn‚Äôt dissolve on its own, even if you don‚Äôt need it anymore. Having a Heart-Wall long-term is like living in a bomb shelter, it‚Äôs necessary short-term to protect you while the ‚Äúbombs‚Äù are falling, but if you continue to ‚Äúlive‚Äù in there you‚Äôll feel sad, disconnected, frustrated and you could even end up with heart disease or other heart problems down the road. The Heart-Wall can be removed, one emotion at a time, freeing you to live from your heart, create abundance and experience true love. Isn‚Äôt that what life is all about?‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Nelson

                        Pain
    Pain is the way the body communicates with us, it‚Äôs saying ‚Äúhey, somethings not right here, please take a look.‚Äù  However, we usually ‚Äúband-aid‚Äù the situation by resorting to outside sources (medication, alcohol, food, drugs, etc.) to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem, but this only buries the core issue. Fortunately, the Emotion Code and The Body Code can help you to understand what your body is desperately trying to tell you and get to the core issues, instead of covering them up or ignoring them.
You can prevent scary pains and illnesses from surfacing with regular energy work to maintain balance, I recommend weekly sessions to start with and then a few a month to keep up on maintenance. It‚Äôs kind of like brushing your teeth, you need to clean your energy body and physical body to keep them in working order.
If you‚Äôre already overwhelmed with pain and discomfort, don‚Äôt worry, we may just need to do more sessions more often to bring you back to balance.  It‚Äôs like peeling back the layers of an onion, it may take some time to get to the center depending on how big the onion is. So let‚Äôs get started today!

                        Releasing
    How are imbalances corrected? Intention, Magnets and the Governing Meridian.  Just like a magnifying glass will intensify sunlight enough to start a fire, magnets can act as an amplifier for the energy of your thoughts and intentions, enough to produce a change in the body. The intentions and thoughts we have are energy. Magnets are energy. Your body is energy. Because of this, one can have an effect on the other. When imbalances are discovered through The Emotion Code or The Body Code,  intention is used to release it, using a magnet to amplify this signal and put it into the body. The Governing Meridian is the entrance point for the amplified intention energy, because the Governing Meridian is an energy reservoir ( which starts at the upper lip, goes up and over the head all the way down to the tail bone) that connects directly to all the acupuncture meridians of the entire body. So when energy is put into the Governing Meridian, it flows instantly throughout the body and the energy shifts!

                              About
Life‚Äôs Wifi is an alternative healing company. Healing is performed through energy work, by correcting imbalances which allows the body to heal itself. The body may seem to be material, but it is actually an energy field that is governed by the mind, more specifically the subconscious mind. Which means, we are our own answer to better health and wellness.

The founder of Life‚Äôs Wifi, Mallarie Milano, feels that they have finally found the answers they have been seeking all their life through the Emotion & Body Code. Natural healing and helping others is of the utmost importance to them. Throughout their life they searched for the ‚Äúthing‚Äù that would truly help people. They explored many different avenues such as; massage, psychology, nutrition, and even veterinary care, but none of these fully resonated with them, these were only pieces of the puzzle. As they began to study and practice the Emotion & Body Code they knew this was what they were looking for all along.

Mal was heavily influenced by their Grandma Kaye who practiced nursing in her younger years, but went on to become a natural healer and Master Herbalist in her later years.  Grandma Kaye was a blessing to the family and showed them how the body can heal itself through the use of herbs, Reflexology, and Iridology.  Unfortunately, in 2012 the family suffered the loss of Grandma and the knowledge she carried with her.  Mal felt an urge to fill Grandma Kaye‚Äôs shoes and become the family healer, but a back injury was holding them back from completing the most basic daily tasks.  After seeing a chiropractor four times a week for almost a year the pain was still unbearable and they were completely frustrated.  Thankfully, their Mom introduced them to the Emotion Code and Body Code.  (Thanks, Mom!)  After many, many  long nights of reading and studying, they began practicing and working on their own back.  The changes they felt were instant and in those first moments, they knew this was their calling.

Mal is a now a Certified Emotion Code and Certified Body Code Practitioner. They work on people all over the country from their home in Oregon and is amazed at what the body is capable of healing from, it is truly miraculous!
